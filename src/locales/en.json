    "javaScript": "JavaScript is the most commonly used programming language for adding interactivity to websites. With this language, actions such as clicking buttons or filling out forms on web pages become dynamic. Today, it is used not only in browsers but also on servers thanks to Node.js technology. With this feature, JavaScript is a versatile language that can be used for both frontend and backend development. In short, JavaScript is one of the fundamental building blocks of the modern internet, and learning it is a major step forward in the world of software development.",
    "reactJs": "ReactJS is a JavaScript-based library used for building user interfaces. It was developed by Facebook and is one of the most popular frontend technologies today. Thanks to its component-based structure, React allows code to be more organized, reusable, and easy to manage. In addition, its Virtual DOM structure enables web pages to update quickly and improves performance. In short, ReactJS is an excellent tool for developing modern, fast, and scalable web applications.",
    "nodeJs": "Node.js is an open-source runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side. It enables JavaScript to run outside the browser, making it easier to develop web servers and backend applications. With its event-driven and non-blocking (asynchronous) architecture, Node.js allows the creation of high-performance and scalable applications. Additionally, its extensive package ecosystem, npm (Node Package Manager), provides access to many ready-to-use libraries. In short, Node.js is a powerful tool that offers fast and efficient backend solutions in modern web development.",

    "profileAboutMeAnsw": "Hello, I would like to briefly talk about myself. My interest in programming started when I was a child. Around the ages of 14-15, I was very interested in scripts. Later, I focused on the C# language to build my foundations, and I completed this process by publishing a script before taking a break. Currently, I consider myself part of the front-end developer field. In the future, you can be sure that I will also venture into the back-end side, which I am more interested in.",
    "project_1": "Workintech has been the main guide in my interest in software. Even though I already had some knowledge of programming, I didn’t know what direction to take. Workintech showed me the right path and helped me gain knowledge in areas I was unfamiliar with. Thanks to its instructors and well-structured system, I can confidently say that I’ve had a successful learning experience.",
    "project_2": "I present the text color guessing game I developed under the guidance and instructions of my instructor Alihan Güzel, whom I met while I was a part of Workintech. This project is one of the first front-end projects I developed, helping me improve my JavaScript logic and design skills. I have shared all the source code for this project openly on my GitHub account for everyone worldwide.",
    "project_3": "Web Pizza is another front-end project I developed while I was a part of Workintech. In this project, I focused heavily on the concepts of useState and Props, turning my knowledge of these topics into practical experience and creative problem-solving skills. I proudly present this project to your attention — all the source code is openly available on my GitHub account for everyone worldwide.",
